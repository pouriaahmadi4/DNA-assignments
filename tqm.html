        <h1>Total Quality Management (TQM)</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>TQM</strong> is a management approach that means that the
          organization’s culture is defined by and supports the constant
          attainment of customer satisfaction through an integrated system of
          tools, techniques, and training. This involves the continuous
          improvement of organizational processes, resulting in high quality
          products and services.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Principles of TQM</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Customer-focused</span>: The customer
            ultimately determines the level of quality. No matter what an
            organization does to foster quality improvement—training employees,
            integrating quality into the design process, or upgrading computers
            or software—the customer determines whether the efforts were
            worthwhile.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Total employee involvement</span>: All
            employees participate in working toward common goals. Total employee
            commitment can only be obtained after fear has been driven from the
            workplace, when empowerment has occurred, and when management has
            provided the proper environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Process-centered</span>: A fundamental part of
            TQM is a focus on process thinking. A process is a series of steps
            that take inputs from suppliers (internal or external) and
            transforms them into outputs that are delivered to customers
            (internal or external). The steps required to carry out the process
            are defined, and performance measures are continuously monitored in
            order to detect unexpected variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Integrated system</span>: Although an
            organization may consist of many different functional specialties
            often organized into vertically structured departments, it is the
            horizontal processes interconnecting these functions that are the
            focus of TQM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Strategic and systematic approach</span>: A
            critical part of the management of quality is the strategic and
            systematic approach to achieving an organization’s vision, mission,
            and goals. This process, called strategic planning or strategic
            management, includes the formulation of a strategic plan that
            integrates quality as a core component.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Continual improvement</span>: A major thrust
            of TQM is continual process improvement. Continual improvement
            drives an organization to be both analytical and creative in finding
            ways to become more competitive and more effective at meeting
            stakeholder expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Fact-based decision making</span>: In order to
            know how well an organization is performing, data on performance
            measures are necessary. TQM requires that an organization
            continually collect and analyze data in order to improve decision
            making accuracy, achieve consensus, and allow prediction based on
            past history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword">Communications</span>: During times of
            organizational change, as well as part of day-to-day operation,
            effective communications plays a large part in maintaining morale
            and in motivating employees at all levels.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Implement <span class="keyword">T</span>otal <span class="keyword">Q</span>uality <span class="keyword">M</span>anagement</h2>
        <p>TQM is a unique process. There is not a specific formula for implementing a system that suits every business and each type of industry. But you can create a checklist of issues that might suit your enterprise and proceed with them in chronological order. Some may suit your business while others will not. Select those that you think will provide an advantage.</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Identify your company’s existing culture, its core values, and its systems.</li>
         <li>Use this information to create a system that will serve as your master plan.</li>
         <li>Establish what your customers and clients want and what they expect from your business. Determine how to best meet these expectations and needs.</li>
         <li>Create a team of management and employees to guide and implement your goals and
         include these efforts in your daily business management process.</li>
         <li>Consistently gather feedback from both employees and customers to gauge your progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword-two">Purpose</span>: A <span class="ms">Mission statement</span> describes the overall purpose of an organization and why it exists. On the other hand, <span class="lto">long-term objectives</span> are specific goals that the organization aims to achieve over a certain period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword-two">Time-Frame</span>: A <span class="ms">Mission statement</span> is generally timeless and remains relevant unless the organization undergoes significant changes. <span class="lto">long-term objectives</span>, however, have a specific timeline for completion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword-two">Specificity</span>: <span class="ms">Mission statement</span>s are broad and focus on the overall direction of the organization. In contrast, <span class="lto">long-term objectives</span> are more specific, measurable, and outline the steps needed to achieve the mission.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword-two">Audience</span>: A <span class="ms">Mission statement</span> is meant for both internal and external audiences, informing employees, customers, and stakeholders about the organization’s purpose. <span class="lto">long-term objectives</span> are primarily for internal use, guiding the organization’s strategies and operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="keyword-two">Changeability</span>: <span class="ms">Mission statement</span>s are usually stable and change infrequently. <span class="lto">long-term objectives</span>, however, may be adjusted or updated based on the organization’s progress and changing circumstances.
